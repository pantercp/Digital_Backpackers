                <h2>Colombia</h2>
                <p>Ever since their discovery in the 16th century, the Galapagos have held fascination for travellers
                    far and wide. But what exactly makes the islands so special? Completely isolated from the outside
                    world, a new wave of fearless endemic species were freely left to evolve. In fact, this bubble is so
                    unique that it inspired the basis for Darwin’s theory of evolution.</p>
                <h3>Things To Know</h3>
                <p>So, first question to ask yourself when considering a trip to the Galapagos? Essentially, it’s
                    choosing how to visit. The two main options are cruises (often very expensive), or staying in
                    accommodation on land (more budget-friendly).
                </p>
                <h3>Culture</h3>
                <p>The Galapagos Islands are home to an abundance of wildlife due to their unique geographical location
                    and isolation from the mainland. The islands are located in the Pacific Ocean, over 900 kilometers
                    off the coast of Ecuador. This isolation has allowed species to evolve independently, leading to the
                    development of unique adaptations and characteristics. <br><br> Additionally, the islands' diverse
                    habitats,
                    including volcanic terrain, beaches, and mangroves, provide a range of niches for different species
                    to thrive. Furthermore, the Galapagos National Park has implemented strict conservation measures to
                    protect the islands' wildlife and their habitats, which has contributed to the preservation of the
                    unique and diverse ecosystems found in the Galapagos.
                </p>
                <h2 class="main-head">Destinations</h2>
                <p>Having stayed on all three of the main islands, we thought it would be particularly useful to share
                    our experience and tips for each of those islands.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>▪️ DAY 1 – Fly into Santa Cruz and get settled at your hostel. Find a good bakery for
                            breakfasts, and scout the many agencies to gauge the cost of tours. Walk to the fish market
                            to spot your first sea lions, marine iguanas and pelicans. Keep walking to Playa de la
                            Estacion to snorkel or lounge. <br><br>

                            ▪️ DAY 2 – Make the 40-minute walk to Tortuga Bay in the morning – one of the world’s most
                            beautiful beaches. Continue onto Playa Mansa for snorkelling. In the afternoon, take a water
                            taxi across to Las Grietas for snorkelling between these epic rock formations.<br><br>

                            ▪️ DAY 3 – Full-day trip to Isla Bartolome – the quintessential Galapagos island. After a
                            2.5 hour boat journey, you’ll begin by hiking to the summit for that most iconic view.
                            Swimming with sea lions, sharks and possibly even Galapagos penguins comes next, followed by
                            lunch and a 2.5 hour ride back to Santa Cruz.<br><br>

                            ▪️ DAY 4 – Visit the Charles Darwin Research Station to learn about the islands’ history and
                            biodiversity. The site also houses a tortoise rehabilitation centre. End the day at one of
                            the beaches or Lagunas de las Ninfas.<br><br>

                            ▪️ DAY 5 – Rent bikes or take a taxi to El Chato Ranch to see semi-wild giant tortoises and
                            the remarkable Bellavista lava tunnels. Los Gemelos are also closeby, two collapsed volcano
                            calderas that have been reclaimed by nature. Enjoy your final evening in Santa Cruz.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>▪️ DAY 6 – Take the ferry from Santa Cruz to Isla Isabela. Once you’ve freshed up at your
                            hostel, go find a bakery, a merienda dinner menu for later and enquire about tour prices.
                            Spend the rest of the day walking along La Playita, or spotting flamingos at Laguna
                            Salinas.<br><br>

                            ▪️ DAY 7 – Start the day bright and early with a tour to Los Tuneles, where you will make
                            several stops to snorkel and explore the otherworldly landscapes. Expect to see sharks, sea
                            turtles, penguins, sea horses and various rays.<br><br>

                            ▪️ DAY 8 – Rent a bike or hike to The Wall of Tears, the Galapagos’ most haunting historic
                            site. Along the way, you’ll pass several smaller beaches and paths leading to viewpoints,
                            lakes and natural coves. Keep a look out for wild giant tortoises on this route too – we saw
                            five in total!<br><br>

                            ▪️ DAY 9 – Join a tour and trek up Sierra Negra, home to the world’s second largest volcanic
                            crater. Continue onto the lunar-like landscapes of Cerro Azul. Then, spend the afternoon
                            snorkelling at Concha de Perla, before a relaxing final evening on Isabela.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>▪️ DAY 10 – Take the morning ferry back to Santa Cruz. Kill time at the beach or camp out in
                            a cafe, before catching the afternoon ferry to San Cristobal. Be sure to pack motion
                            sickness tablets for this long-winded travel day.<br><br>

                            Arrive on San Cristobal after a long travel day. Take in the many sea lions lounging by the
                            docks. If you check-in and drop your bags off in time for sunset, then head on over to Playa
                            Mann. Then, scout the side roads of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno for your first merienda
                            here.<br><br>

                            ▪️ DAY 11 – Begin with a visit to the Interpretation Center, possibly the most informative
                            exhibition on the Galapagos. Head up to Cerro Tijeretas next to get your fill of island
                            vistas, followed by snorkelling at Las Tijeretas, a spot frequented by sea turtles, sea
                            lions and even sharks.<br><br>

                            ▪️ DAY 12 – Embark on the 360 Tour, where you will sail around the whole of San Cristobal,
                            making several beach and snorkel stops. The main highlight comes at the end – Kicker Rock –
                            a vertical formation jutting wildly out of the ocean, with some of the Galapagos’ best
                            diving found below. Prepare to see all kinds of wildlife, including hammerhead sharks if
                            you’re lucky.<br><br>

                            ▪️ DAY 13 – Your final full day on the Galapagos is reserved for La Loberia. It’s an easy
                            2km walk from town. Eventually, you’ll reach a sheltered cove with great snorkelling.
                            Continue onto El Barranco for a chance to see blue-footed boobies. Then, enjoy one final
                            sunset at Playa Mann.<br><br>

                            ▪️ DAY 14 – Depending on when your flight is, you may have time for a final stroll through
                            town before heading to the airport. If you plan to buy gifts or souvenirs, then this is a
                            final chance to browse through some shops.</p>

                <span class="it-bd-blck">Food & Accommodation</span>
                <p> We did however manage to keep our food & accommodation costs pretty low, on average spending between
                    $4-7pp per dinner out. We stayed in hostels on each island, which averaged out to £13pp per night
                    over
                    13 nights.</p>
                <span class="it-bd-blck">Flights & Taxes</span>
                <p> The two biggest costs were flights & excursions, alongside the $100 tourist tax you must pay upon
                    arrival. Therefore, while flights are generally around this price year-round, you can choose to
                    spend
                    less depending on the excursions you do.</p>
                <span class="it-bd-blck">Excursions</span>
                <p> Initially, we budgeted $100 each per island for tours ($300 total each). As you can see, we exceeded
                    this, but it was a price we were willing to pay for the incredible experiences that followed. The
                    three
                    tours we did do were Isla Bartolome ($200pp), Los Tuneles ($90pp) and the 360 Tour on San Cristobal
                    ($160pp). More to come soon on each experience!</p>
                <span class="it-bd-blck">Thoughts</span>
                <p> This is (and probably will be for a while) our most expensive breakdown to date, especially when
                    compared to our usual daily budget of £25 each. However, opportunities don't come by often to visit
                    this unworldly paradise, so we believe it was something well worth stretching the budget for.
                </p>
                <h2>Exursions</h2>
                <p>In contrast, we pretty much had the untouched beauty of Bartolome to ourselves and there were no
                    other groups while we were snorkelling. It’s iconic landscapes were incredible to witness. And
                    finally, the remoteness really does make you feel as though you’ve travelled back, to a time before
                    the islands were discovered.</p>
                <h2 class="sub-head">Isla Bartolome</h2>
                <p>This is quite possibly the best place we have ever been. It's remoteness and untouched beauty makes
                    you feel like you are on a different planet. There is so much wildlife it's hard to comprehend, this
                    is also where we had our first ever encounter with a shark.</p>

                    <p>The golden rule for eating cheap on the Galapagos: look for meriendas. These are set dinner
                        menus offered at local restaurants, and typically come with a starter and drink too. Our
                        most expensive dinner was $7 each, our cheapest was $4, so this really is a great way to get
                        value for money compared to touristy restaurants that could see you spending $20 per meal.

                        the islands were discovered.

                        actually significantly cheaper, and from what we heard can grant even greater wildlife
                        encounters. We recommend you still do your own research when deciding, but that’s just a thought
                        to keep in mind.

                        This would definitely be the next best excursion to go for, as the landmark is known to be one

                <h2>Preperation For The Galapagos</h2>
                <p>There’s a pre-registration form to complete before flying into the Galapagos. It’s similar to COVID
                    entry forms, in that it asks where and for how long you’re staying on the islands. Be sure to fill
                    this out ahead of your trip through <a
                        href="https://www.gobiernogalapagos.gob.ec/step-by-step-tct-online/">this link</a>.</p>
                <p>All visitors must purchase a tourist transit card at the airport in mainland Ecuador. This costs $20
                    and is something you need to keep as it has to be returned upon your departure. It is separate to
                    the $100 entry tax visitors pay upon arrival. However, if you are Ecuadorian, or hold nationality
                    from another South American country, this tax is cheaper.</p>
                <p>November to May is the best time to go, when the weather is warmer and the oceans are most calm and
                    prime for snorkelling/diving. Our 2-week trip was in June, during which we had a mix of cloudy skies
                    and sun, as well as some very choppy ferry crossings.</p>

                <h2>Budgeting</h2>
                <p>Being a remote archipaelego and a place of focused conservation efforts (rightly so), The Galapagos
                    Islands is never going to be one of your cheapest visits. However, with careful planning and a bit
                    of research we believe you can stretch your budget to get the most value. Here are some of our best
                    tips on how we managed to save a significant amount of money:</p>
                <div class="contain-tips accordion">
                    <h3>Budgeting Tips</h3>
                    <div class="accordion-container">
                        <div class="accordion-header">

                            <h4>ATMs</h4>
                            <div class="btn-reveal"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Cash is king in the Galapagos and not many places take card, so be sure to withdraw as much
                            as
                            you’re comfortable carrying before flying out. There are ATMs on the islands, but almost all
                            have a
                            fee (typically $4) as well as a withdrawal limit per day ($200-$300).

                            Note: Isla Isabela is most limited so be sure to withdraw before travelling here. Supposedly
                            there
                            is only one ATM on the whole island, but even that was out of order at the time of our
                            visit.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The golden rule for eating cheap on the Galapagos: look for meriendas. These are set dinner
                            menus offered at local restaurants, and typically come with a starter and drink too. Our
                            most expensive dinner was $7 each, our cheapest was $4, so this really is a great way to get
                            value for money compared to touristy restaurants that could see you spending $20 per meal.

                        <p>There are only two crossings between the islands per day, so if you have set travel dates,
                            don’t delay booking this. A one-way ferry typically costs $30 per person, however some
                            agencies may offer a small discount if you book a return journey. We got a discounted rate
                            for booking all journeys with our hostel in Santa Cruz.

                        <p>This is where haggling can really pay off, but some alternative strategies for finding cheap

                            next morning, so make sure to enquire about this first. You could also bag a discount by
                            booking all your tours with one agency, or liaisoning with other travellers and booking in a
                            group.
